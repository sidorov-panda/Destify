<h3>Description</h3>
  Have you forgot your phone in another room and waiting for an inportant message?<br/>
  Destify is a brand new tweak, to keep you always notified!<br/>
  Once installed and set up, this tweak will forward all your received notifications to your personal computer.<br/>
  Doesn't matter, if it is from WhatsApp, Facebook, Email or SMS. All of the Notifications!<br/>
  You just have to install the Java server on your PC and type in the IP address and Portnumber on your phone.<br/>
  Notifications will be displayed in a unique sleek way, stackled on the right side of your display, with dynamic background colors based on the icon.<br/>
<br/>
  You can make a notification sticky, by clicking on the pin at the right top of the notification.<br/>
  Beware: You won't be able to answer the notifications!<br/>

<h3>Open-Source</h3>
  Intended to be a paid tweak, it was rejected by Optimo from TheBigBoss. So I made it available for free and open-sourced it.<br/>
